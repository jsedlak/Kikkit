When creating a CommandListener object, the onCommand method needs 
to follow certain procedures.

public abstract boolean onCommand(
    PlayerChatEvent event, 
    String[] cmdData, 
    Player sourcePlayer
);

This is distinctly different to how Bukkit handles commands. With
Bukkit, event.setCancelled(true) is called whenever a command is
handled.

We want to make the distinction between when a command is actually
handled and when it errors out. To do this, the method returns a 
boolean that is TRUE when the workflow should not continue.

Here are a few rules to follow:

When the method knows the command, always return true.
When the method doesn't understand the command, return false.
When the method uses the command, run event.setCancelled(true).
When the method doesn't use the command, ignore event.setCancelled.
